# Modified Voxel Theme

Place your modified Voxel theme files in this directory.

This folder should contain the Voxel theme files that include your custom modifications. Ensure that the base version matches the one in the `../voxel-original/` directory for accurate comparison.

The modification extraction scripts will compare the files in this directory with those in `../voxel-original/` to identify changes and new files.
